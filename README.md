# HbA1c_Error_Sim
This repository is to house the code used in the HbA1c error simulation manuscript. 
In the future, I will retain a copy of the original code and a cleaned-up version.
Additionally, I will build a simulation pipeline for arbitrary laboratory measures in a different repository.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
I do not have the right to distribute NHANES data. Because of this I will add dummy data, similar in distribution but not the actual data.




# TODO
1) Clean up the code a fair bit and simplify its use in the next week.
2) Add additional external documentation pdf format.
3) I plan to make a more robust version of this code (Simulation Pipeline) that can be used for any laboratory test.
